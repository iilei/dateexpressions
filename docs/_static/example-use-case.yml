  notes: |-
    This Job is scheduled to run at the first day of the month.
    If triggered manually at random times the reported time frame is
    equal to the time frame of a scheduled run:

    Aggregation of a report on the time frame between
    past month's last saturday and this months last saturday.

    To verify an arbitrary relative date expression for a
    number of upcoming points in time, run:

    ```sh
      date-expression preflight \
          --max-results 5 \
          --cron '0 0 1 * *' \
          'now /* add modifiers here ... */' |
          jq '.yields | unique'
    ```

    -- requires `jq` json parser and pip package `dateexpressions[preflight]`
